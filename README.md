### Welcome to my profile! :zap:

I am Jean de Malliard, a French computer science enthusiast :computer: \
I had an engineering degree in Information Systems and Cybersecurity in France, and just finished a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems at Boston University :mortar_board: \
Now, I am looking for a software engineer position in the US (preference for New-York City) \
I especially like operating systems and everything related to low-level programming. I like dealing with the functioning of things :wrench:\
Consequently, I love working with **C/C++**, and I am very interested in learning **Rust**
