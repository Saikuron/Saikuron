*Note: I haven't been very active on Github lately*

### Who am I?

I am Jean de Malliard, a French computer science enthusiast :computer: \
I had an engineering degree in Information Systems and Cybersecurity in France, and finished a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems at Boston University :mortar_board: \
I especially like operating systems and everything related to low-level programming. I like dealing with the functioning of things :wrench:\
Consequently, I love working with **C/C++**, and I started to learn **Rust**

### What else?

:musical_note: I enjoy producing music in my free time, mainly hip-hop or electronic music, or more experimental style. I'm using mainly dedicated hardware like synthesizers or grooveboxes \
 \
:dancer: I love dancing. I practice hip-hop freestyle a lot and started again salsa and bachata recently \
 \
:runner: I love sport, I tried a lot of different ones. I am currently doing weightlifting and tennis
